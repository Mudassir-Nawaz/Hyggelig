    heading: Hyggelig is more than just a coworking space
    detail: "<p>As our long-time Coworkers say: Hyggelig is “Nik’s place”. <br><br> After trying out the good, the bad and the ugly, Nikolaj decided to gather everything he was looking for in a Coworking Space, and started a place of his own, where he is both the manager and a Coworker himself.<br><br>
Hyggelig comes from the Danish word “hygge”, a non-directly translatable word which describes a feeling of coziness, warmth, and contentment. <br><br>
We want you to experience that feeling every time you come to work at Hyggelig.</p><br><br>"
