    heading: Hyggelig Was Founded In 2020 By Nikolaj And Nídia, A Danish-Azorean Couple Who Wanted To Bring A New Level Of Office Comfort To Lisbon's Coworking Scene.
    detail: "<p>Especially for Nikolaj, as an expat and remote worker, it was important to have a coworking space that is both comfortable and has a relatable and friendly community. Located in the heart of Intendente, our naturally bright cowork is placed in a charming old apartment with a stunning wooden floor that has been refurbished and turned into a coworking space. With inspiration in Nordic design principles of clean and functional as well as warm and welcoming, we have aimed to create a space that embodies the feeling of 'hygge,' the Danish word that conveys a sense of cosiness, warmth, and contentment. </p>"
    second_para: "Being aware of the sense of comfortability in office equipment (Danish law has high mandatory requirements on this matter), we have created a place where you can decide whether you want to stand up for work, or just adjust your table and sit comfortably. This means that not only can all our tables be adjusted to the right height for everyone, but also that you can change between standing and sitting at the desk throughout the day. When you decide to sit and work, our ergonomic chairs can be adjusted to you and your preferred setting as well.<br><br>Our monthly plan includes a range of amenities that make workdays more enjoyable: high-speed internet, printer and scanner, a fully stocked kitchen (free coffee, tea and cookies), storage lockers, a call booth and meeting room."
    third_para: "On the other hand, we believe that a good work space is not just about physical comfort and getting work done. It is also about having great coworkers, after all you are spending a large portion of the day with them. <br><br>
We know it is important - but sometimes difficult - to build new social circles and friendships when attending a Coworking space where the majority of people are only staying in the country for a handful of weeks. For that reason, currently we only offer monthly plans, striving to create a community of people who share a passion for their work, and want to connect with other professionals, share ideas, collaborate on projects and make the most of their time."
